Calculator ReadMe

Overview: 

      This is a simple calculator I built in Java using multiple classes to keep everything organized. 
      Each button, including numbers, operators, and special functions, has its own behavior, and the 
      display updates based on what you click. I used loops and arrays to create the buttons and set their
      styles, and helper methods to handle calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
      percentages, and changing the sign of numbers.

      I also thought carefully about how to organize the code so that the Calculator class manages the UI, 
      the Board squares know how to move or update themselves, and the logic stays separate from the design. 
      Overall, it uses loops, conditional statements, and helper methods to make sure everything runs smoothly 
      while keeping the code structured and easy to understand.
